							‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
							professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
							student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
							did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
							project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
							could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
							experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
							100% recommend! ‚Äù
